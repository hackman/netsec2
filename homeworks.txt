Homeworks for this course are ongoing...
You can submit PoC(Proof-of-Concept) exploits as soon as you have them.

The task is simple, find security issues within the following software:
- Moodle
- Joomla
- WordPress
- FFmpeg/AVconv (they are pretty close)
- Linux Kernel

Every proven security issue is elidgable for 1 to 3 points.

If you have worked on any other opensource software and have reported a software security issue to them or want to work on auditing that code, please first consult with the teachers of the course.
