Everything in Python is an Object... or it should have been :)
 - types of objects are not backward compatible
   bytes() in 2.x and in 3.x
 - since everything is an object, comparrison between objects is a problem. Given that we have x of type int and y of type float, the next code should not work:
   if x > y:

A TON of people will tell you that PEP 8 is a Secure codding guideline.
NO, IT ISN'T!
It is a comperhansive style guide!

Now let's take a look at two major parts from the language:
 - C modules security
 - Python native issues
    dangerous modules: json, pickle, cPickle
