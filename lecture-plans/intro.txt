- Programming languages
  - What is machine code?
  - What is a compiled language?
  - What is a interpretative language?
    - Why are they slower... simply because "if ($a == 0)" can be translated to:
    1. get the addres of an elemet of this($a) data structure
    2. convert this element to integer(because most probably it is not and int)
    3. convert 0 to integer
    4. add the converted variables as parameters to the cmopare() function
    5. the compare() function executes the cmp CPU instruction
  - What is just-in-time compilation?
